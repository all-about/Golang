What golang is and what it is not?  
  
Is:  
Ease of Use:  The syntax is clean and accessible to newcomers, and there aren** â€™ **t a lot of complex functions to learn.The close similarities to C-style languages mean that it will be a simple language to learn for programmers proficient in C++ or C#.  
  
Smart standard library:Go users can accomplish a lot without having to import or learn complicated secondary libraries.  
  
Is Not:  
1. Enterprise solutions Library.  
2. sometimes too simplistic: Not giving smart abstractions that allow coders to achieve complex and clever results with less  
3. Lack of virtual machine: Go files compiled files sizes are big.

Not Have:  
Constructors and Destructors  
  
A job of constructors is to head start and initialize an object, whereas destructor is to destroy the object after its life time and free up memory. Unlike other object oriented programming, Go does not have classes. Hence the concept of constructors and destructors does not exist.  
  
Default values  
  
Operator overloading  
  
No classes but have interfaces  
No inheritance => no classes but implicit interface inheritance  
  
No generics:

Conclusion:The creation of Go was focused on simplicity and elegance. It is fast, small and have simple syntax. There are less concepts to wrap your head around unlike other OOP languages. Simplicity is the key to a good software but depends on your use case.**
